# IRECKONU_FileProcessingApp

This is the first version of the app. It has all required functions, adheres to solid principle and utilizes layered architecture. 

To further improve on this app we could add some filters for archiving the incoming CSV file for logging and security purproses. 
Json saving could be made more flexible with different folder structure based on ENV settings and/or business logic.
Our domain layer could utilize some MQ technology to make file processing more async and more reliable.
All this code was written with testability in mind, so adding Unit or integration tests won't be an issue.

If you would like to see me act on any of these points - feel free to contact me. I would love to discuss it with you.
